# Software
#### Single Cell Transcriptome
- [**TISCH**](http://tisch.comp-genomics.org) &nbsp;
Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) is a scRNA-seq database focusing on tumor microenvironment (TME). TISCH provides detailed cell-type annotation at the single-cell level, enabling the exploration of TME across different cancer types.

#### Single Cell Epigenetics
- [**MAESTRO**](http://github.com/liulab-dfci/MAESTRO) &nbsp;
Model-based Analyses of Transcriptome and Regulome (MAESTRO) is a comprehensive open-source computational workflow for integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data from multiple platforms.

#### Single Cell CRISPR Screen
- [**SCREEN**](https://github.com/HailinWei98/SCREEN/) &nbsp;
SCREEN (Single-cell CRISPR scREen data analyses and pErturbation modeliNg) is a pipeline to visualize the quality of single-cell CRISPR screens RNA-seq/ATAC-seq datasets.

#### Spatial Transcriptome
- [**STRIDE**](https://github.com/DongqingSun96/STRIDE) &nbsp;
Spatial transcriptomics deconvolution by topic modeling (STRIDE) is a topic-model-based deconvolution method for spatial transcriptomics by integrating with matched scRNA-seq.
- [**STREAM**](https://github.com/YeehanXiao/STREAM) &nbsp;
STREAM is a analysis pipeline for processing spatial transcriptomic data.
