desp: Chenfei Wang received his B.S. and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Tongji University in 2012 and 2017. During his Ph.D. period, he studied epigenetic reprogramming and its effect on embryogenesis and cell fate determination in mammalian early embryos and somatic nuclear transferred (SCNT) embryos. He joined Xiaole Shirley Liu's lab as a postdoctoral researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University in 2018 and developed computational algorithms for integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Now he is a Professor at the School of Life Science and Technology at Tongji University. His research focuses on developing computational algorithms and performing big data mining on high throughput data to understand the role of gene regulation and cellular crosstalks in cell state transition and fate determination. <br/> Dr. Wang is a recipient of the Ray Wu Prize, Shanghai Rising Star Program, Excellence Award and Academic Pioneer of Tongji Univerisity. Dr. Wang has been supported by The Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Program of China and The Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
